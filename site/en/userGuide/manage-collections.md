# Manage Collections

This guide walks you through creating and managing collections using the SDK of your choice.

## Before you start

- You have installed [Milvus standalone](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md) or [Milvus cluster](https://milvus.io/docs/install_cluster-milvusoperator.md).

- You have installed preferred SDKs. You can choose among various languages, including [Python](https://milvus.io/docs/install-pymilvus.md), [Java](https://milvus.io/docs/install-java.md), [Go](https://milvus.io/docs/install-go.md), and [Node.js](https://milvus.io/docs/install-node.md).

## Overview

In Milvus, you store your vector embeddings in collections. All vector embeddings within a collection share the same dimensionality and distance metric for measuring similarity. 

Milvus collections support dynamic fields (i.e., fields not pre-defined in the schema) and automatic incrementation of primary keys.

To accommodate different preferences, Milvus offers two methods for creating a collection. One provides a quick setup, while the other allows for detailed customization of the collection schema and index parameters.

Additionally, you can view, load, release, and drop a collection when necessary.

The code snippets on this page use new <a href="https://milvus.io/api-reference/pymilvus/v2.4.x/About.md">MilvusClient</a> (Python) to interact with Milvus. New MilvusClient SDKs for other languages will be released in future updates.

## Create Collection

You can create a collection in either of the following manners:

- __Quick setup__

    In this manner, you can create a collection by simply giving it a name and specifying the number of dimensions of the vector embeddings to be stored in this collection. For details, refer to [Quick setup](manage-collections.md).

- __Customized setup__

    Instead of letting In Milvus decide almost everything for your collection, you can determine the __schema__ and __index parameters__ of the collection on your own. For details, refer to [Customized setup](manage-collections.md).

### Quick setup

Milvus allows a quick setup of such a collection with just three arguments: 

- Name of the collection to create,

- Dimension of the vector embeddings to insert, and

- Metric type used to measure similarities between vector embeddings.

```python
from pymilvus import MilvusClient, DataType

# 1. Set up a Milvus client
client = MilvusClient(
    uri="http://localhost:19530"
)

# 2. Create a collection in quick setup mode
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="quick_setup",
    dimension=5
)

res = client.get_load_state(
    collection_name="quick_setup"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "state": "<LoadState: Loaded>"
# }
```

The collection generated in the above code contains only two fields: `id` (as the primary key) and `vector` (as the vector field), with `auto_id` and `enable_dynamic_field` settings enabled by default.

- `auto_id` 

    Enabling this setting ensures that the primary key increments automatically. There's no need for manual provision of primary keys during data insertion.

- `enable_dynamic_field`

    When enabled, all fields, excluding `id` and `vector` in the data to be inserted, are treated as dynamic fields. These additional fields are saved as key-value pairs within a special field named `$meta`. This feature allows the inclusion of extra fields during data insertion.

The automatically indexed and loaded collection from the provided code is ready for immediate data insertions.

### Customized setup

Instead of letting Milvus decide almost everything for your collection, you can determine the __schema__ and __index parameters__ of the collection on your own.

#### Step 1: Set up schema

A schema defines the structure of a collection. Within the schema, you have the option to enable or disable `enable_dynamic_field`, add pre-defined fields, and set attributes for each field. For a detailed explanation of the concept and available data types, refer to [Schema Explained](schema.md).

```python
# 3. Create a collection in customized setup mode

# 3.1. Create schema
schema = MilvusClient.create_schema(
    auto_id=False,
    enable_dynamic_field=True,
)

# 3.2. Add fields to schema
schema.add_field(field_name="my_id", datatype=DataType.INT64, is_primary=True)
schema.add_field(field_name="my_vector", datatype=DataType.FLOAT_VECTOR, dim=5)
```

In the provided code snippet for Python, the `enable_dynamic_field` is set to `True`, and `auto_id` is enabled for the primary key. Additionally, a `vector` field is introduced, configured with a dimensionality of 768, along with the inclusion of four scalar fields, each with its respective attributes.

#### Step 2: Set up index parameters

Index parameters dictate how Milvus organizes your data within a collection. You can tailor the indexing process for specific fields by adjusting their `metric_type` and `index_type`. For the vector field, you have the flexibility to select `COSINE`, `L2`, or `IP` as the `metric_type`.

```python
# 3.3. Prepare index parameters
index_params = client.prepare_index_params()

# 3.4. Add indexes
index_params.add_index(
    field_name="my_id",
    index_type="STL_SORT"
)

index_params.add_index(
    field_name="my_vector", 
    index_type="IVF_FLAT",
    metric_type="IP",
    params={ "nlist": 128 }
)
```

The code snippet above demonstrates how to set up index parameters for the vector field and a scalar field, respectively. For the vector field, set both the metric type and the index type. For a scalar field, set only the index type. It is recommended to create an index for the vector field and any scalar fields that are frequently used for filtering.

#### Step 3: Create the collection

You have the option to create a collection and an index file separately or to create a collection with the index loaded simultaneously upon creation.

- __Create a collection with the index loaded simultaneously upon creation.__

    ```python
    # 3.5. Create a collection with the index loaded simultaneously
    client.create_collection(
        collection_name="customized_setup_1",
        schema=schema,
        index_params=index_params
    )
    
    time.sleep(5)
    
    res = client.get_load_state(
        collection_name="customized_setup_1"
    )
    
    print(res)
    
    # Output
    #
    # {
    #     "state": "<LoadState: Loaded>"
    # }
    ```

    The collection created above is loaded automatically. To learn more about loading and releasing a collection, refer to [Load & Release Collection](manage-collections.md). 

- __Create a collection and an index file separately.__

    ```python
    # 3.6. Create a collection and index it separately
    client.create_collection(
        collection_name="customized_setup_2",
        schema=schema,
    )
    
    res = client.get_load_state(
        collection_name="customized_setup_2"
    )
    
    print(res)
    
    # Output
    #
    # {
    #     "state": "<LoadState: NotLoad>"
    # }
    ```

    The collection created above is not loaded automatically. You can create an index for the collection as follows. Creating an index for the collection in a separate manner does not automatically load the collection. For details, refer to [Load & Release Collection](manage-collections.md).

    ```python
    # 3.6 Create index
    client.create_index(
        collection_name="customized_setup_2",
        index_params=index_params
    )
    
    res = client.get_load_state(
        collection_name="customized_setup_2"
    )
    
    print(res)
    
    # Output
    #
    # {
    #     "state": "<LoadState: NotLoad>"
    # }
    ```

## View Collections

You can check the details of an existing collection as follows:

```python
# 5. View Collections
res = client.describe_collection(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "collection_name": "customized_setup_2",
#     "auto_id": false,
#     "num_shards": 1,
#     "description": "",
#     "fields": [
#         {
#             "field_id": 100,
#             "name": "my_id",
#             "description": "",
#             "type": 5,
#             "params": {},
#             "element_type": 0,
#             "is_primary": true
#         },
#         {
#             "field_id": 101,
#             "name": "my_vector",
#             "description": "",
#             "type": 101,
#             "params": {
#                 "dim": 5
#             },
#             "element_type": 0
#         }
#     ],
#     "aliases": [],
#     "collection_id": 448143479230158446,
#     "consistency_level": 2,
#     "properties": {},
#     "num_partitions": 1,
#     "enable_dynamic_field": true
# }

```

To list all existing collections, you can do as follows:

```python
# 6. List all collection names
res = client.list_collections()

print(res)

# Output
#
# [
#     "customized_setup_2",
#     "quick_setup",
#     "customized_setup_1"
# ]
```

## Load & Release Collection

During the loading process of a collection, Milvus loads the collection's index file into memory. Conversely, when releasing a collection, Milvus unloads the index file from memory. Before conducting searches in a collection, ensure that the collection is loaded.

### Load a collection

To load a collection, use the `load_collection()` method, specifying the collection name. You can also set `replica_number` to determine how many in-memory replicas of data segments to create on query nodes when the collection is loaded.

- Milvus Standalone: The maximum allowed value for `replica_number` is 1.
- Milvus Cluster: The maximum value should not exceed the `queryNode.replicas` set in your Milvus configurations. For additional details, refer to [Query Node-related Configurations](https://milvus.io/docs/configure_querynode.md#Query-Node-related-Configurations).

```python
# 7. Load the collection
client.load_collection(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2",
    replica_number=1 # Number of replicas to create on query nodes. Max value is 1 for Milvus Standalone, and no greater than `queryNode.replicas` for Milvus Cluster.
)

res = client.get_load_state(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "state": "<LoadState: Loaded>"
# }
```

### Release a collection

```python
# 8. Release the collection
client.release_collection(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

res = client.get_load_state(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "state": "<LoadState: NotLoad>"
# }
```

## Set up aliases

You can assign aliases for collections to make them more meaningful in a specific context. You can assign multiple aliases for a collection, but multiple collections cannot share an alias.

### Create aliases

```python
# 9.1. Create aliases
client.create_alias(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2",
    alias="bob"
)

client.create_alias(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2",
    alias="alice"
)
```

### List aliases

```python
# 9.2. List aliases
res = client.list_aliases(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "aliases": [
#         "bob",
#         "alice"
#     ],
#     "collection_name": "customized_setup_2",
#     "db_name": "default"
# }
```

### Describe aliases

```python
# 9.3. Describe aliases
res = client.describe_alias(
    alias="bob"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "alias": "bob",
#     "collection_name": "customized_setup_2",
#     "db_name": "default"
# }
```

### Reassign aliases

```python
# 9.4 Reassign aliases to other collections
client.alter_alias(
    collection_name="customized_setup_1",
    alias="alice"
)

res = client.list_aliases(
    collection_name="customized_setup_1"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "aliases": [
#         "alice"
#     ],
#     "collection_name": "customized_setup_1",
#     "db_name": "default"
# }

res = client.list_aliases(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)

print(res)

# Output
#
# {
#     "aliases": [
#         "bob"
#     ],
#     "collection_name": "customized_setup_2",
#     "db_name": "default"
# }
```

### Drop aliases

```python
# 9.5 Drop aliases
client.drop_alias(
    alias="bob"
)

client.drop_alias(
    alias="alice"
)
```

## Drop a Collection

If a collection is no longer needed, you can drop the collection.

```python
# 10. Drop the collections
client.drop_collection(
    collection_name="quick_setup"
)

client.drop_collection(
    collection_name="customized_setup_1"
)

client.drop_collection(
    collection_name="customized_setup_2"
)
```
